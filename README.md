# Scoring Model for Client Bankruptcy Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to develop a scoring model that automatically predicts the probability of a client's bankruptcy. The model will also provide insights into the features contributing to the predictions, both globally and at an individual client level. The final deliverables include a production-ready API and a testing interface, along with an end-to-end MLOps approach for tracking and analyzing model performance.

## Objectives

1. **Build a Scoring Model**:
   - Develop a predictive model to estimate the probability of client bankruptcy automatically.

2. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - **Global Feature Importance**: Identify which features generally contribute most to the model's predictions.
   - **Local Feature Importance**: Provide insights into which features impact predictions for individual clients to enhance transparency for stakeholders.

3. **Production and Testing**:
   - **Deploy Model**: Implement the scoring model in production through an API.
   - **API Testing Interface**: Create a user-friendly interface to test and validate the API.

4. **MLOps Implementation**:
   - **Experiment Tracking**: Monitor and manage experiments throughout the development cycle.
   - **Data Drift Analysis**: Analyze model performance in production to detect and address data drift.

## Requirements

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Flask/Django (for API), MLflow (for tracking), etc.
- **Tools**: Docker (for containerization), cloud services (for deployment), etc.
